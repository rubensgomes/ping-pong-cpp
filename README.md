# Ping Pong Simulator

This is a very simple C++ code that simulates a pingpong tournament.  
The players along with statistics of in-bound serving/returning the ball
are found in the "data.csv" file.

*  The source code for the pingpong simulator was written in C++ using
   the C++11 standards and the Boost C++ source code (Boost C++ 1.60 
   version code) libraries
  
*  The initial code was written and compiled on a Windows XP 32 bit 
   machine using the Cygwin project - Linux-like environment for Windows.

*  A simple Makefile is provided to build the application.  In order to
   use the Makefile you should open it and change the path to Boost 
   header files appropriately. 

*  A file called "data.csv" is used as the input to the ping pong
   simulation.
